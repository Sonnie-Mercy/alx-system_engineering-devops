# Nginx Traffic Handling Configuration

## Description
This repository contains the Puppet manifest and instructions for adjusting the Nginx configuration to increase the amount of traffic the server can handle. The provided Puppet manifest modifies the default file to increase the ULIMIT and restarts the Nginx service.

## Usage
To use the Puppet manifest:
1. Install Puppet on the target server if not already installed.
2. Create a new Puppet manifest file with the provided content or update an existing one.
3. Run the Puppet manifest using the following command: puppet apply 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp
4. The manifest will modify the default Nginx configuration file and restart the Nginx service to apply the changes.

## Requirements
- Puppet should be installed on the server where the changes are to be applied.
- The user running the Puppet manifest should have the necessary permissions to modify the Nginx configuration and restart the Nginx service.

## Important Note
Make sure to review the changes in the Puppet manifest before running it on the server. This README file is for informational purposes only and should be updated based on your specific use case and requirements.
